Seat him on your lap or facing you while secured in a comfortable high chair. It is a good idea to give him a second child-sized spoon. That way he is less likely to grab your spoon.</p><p>Place a spoonful of meat or iron-fortified infant cereal close to his lips. Give him time to look at it, smell it and taste it. Once he opens his mouth, put the spoon in. If he takes the food, offer another spoonful. If he spits out the food, wait a few minutes and try again.</p><p>You can expect that most of the first solid food you offer will end up on his bib, face and high-chair tray.</p><p><em>This is normal &ndash; you are getting him used to&nbsp;eating solid foods.</em></p>"
