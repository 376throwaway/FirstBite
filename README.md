</p>

The intended audience for our application are mainly parents. More specifically, those who are new to parenthood whose infants can fall into an array of ages and groups (0 – 36 months). The application will aim to be easily accessible and accommodate for those unfamiliar with the iOS interface and systems, while still providing sufficient features to more experienced users. 

Parents, including mothers, fathers, guardians, and so on who require more expertise or knowledge in their child’s nutrition will find our application helpful and accessible. It will be a tool to assist them in their lives and parenting journey. The application will give guidance, tools, and advice necessary to answer most of an individual’s concerns and questions on baby nutrition.
